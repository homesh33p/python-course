First create a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and n(user input), and set values to null
Then fill the dictionary with the square of the numbers as the values of respective keys

Write a Python program to sort a simple non nested dictionary by key. The keys are numbers.

Write a script to check if two non nested simple dictionaries are equal. (every key and value should be equal)

Write a script to find the difference between two lists ie: new list which contains items which are not in either of the lists

Sort a list not by any inbuilt function, but by a script. Then print the location of the sorted values:
eg: [1,5,3,9,0]
result: [4,0,2,1,3]

find the address of a given value in the following dictionary: (Hint : use nested if else statements, and the script will be long :) )
{
	"animals":{
		"mammals":{
			"carnivorous":"Tiger",
			"noncarni":"Cow",
			"omnivorous":"Human
		},
		"birds":{
			"carnivorous":"Eagle",
			"noncarni":"Parrot"
		}
	}
}

User input: parrot
result: animals.birds.noncarni
